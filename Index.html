<h1> What is IIS?</h1>
<p>Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services, IIS, 2S) is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.[2] IIS supports HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0, though it may be absent from some editions (e.g. Windows XP Home edition), and is not active by default. A dedicated suite of software called SEO Toolkit[3] is included in the latest version of the manager. This suite has several tools for SEO with features for metatag / web coding optimization, sitemaps / robots.txt configuration, website analysis, crawler setting, SSL server-side configuration and more.</p>
